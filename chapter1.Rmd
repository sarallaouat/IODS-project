# Exercise 1 
## I am **happy** to be here and it is quite funny to learn coding in R. I heard about the course through the Yammer of the Masters of Public Health programme (UEF) and it is right what I need to move forward with my PhD research. 
## My expectations 
   + Learn how to run statistical analyses in R and apply them to my research 
   + Learn more R functions and apply them 
   + In general, learn better how to use R
